NTFS-3G plugin for reading "system compressed" files

System compression, also known as "Compact OS", is a Windows feature
that allows rarely modified files to be compressed using the XPRESS or
LZX compression formats. It is not built directly into NTFS but rather
is implemented using reparse points. This feature appeared in Windows 10
and it appears that many Windows 10 systems have been using it by
default.

This plugin enables the NTFS-3G FUSE driver to transparently read from
system-compressed files. It must be built against NTFS-3G version
2017.3.23 or later, since that was the first stable version to include
support for reparse point plugins.

Currently, only reading is supported. Compressing an existing file may
be done by using the "compact" utility on Windows, with one of the
options below ("xpress4k" is the weakest and fastest, "lzx" is the
strongest and slowest):

    /exe:xpress4k
    /exe:xpress8k
    /exe:xpress16k
    /exe:lzx

s6-portable-utils is a set of tiny general Unix utilities, often performing
well-known tasks such as cut and grep, but optimized for simplicity and small size.
They were designed for embedded systems and other constrained environments, but they
work everywhere.

Other set of small utilities are usually system-specific; for instance,
the (otherwise good) BusyBox project only works on Linux.

Some of s6-portable-utils' programs are a conformant implementation of a POSIX
utility as determined by the Single Unix Specification, version 4; the relevant
documentation pages mentions this. However, none of the s6-portable-utils programs
supports internationalization.

It is now an explicit non-goal of s6-portable-utils to duplicate the work ofexisting
projects that aim to provide a lightweight implementation of standard commands.
No more rewriting of standard commands will occur in s6-portable-utils; the package
is now used to host specific utilities such as s6-uniquename.

skalibs is only required at build-time, not run-time.

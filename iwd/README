iwd - Wireless daemon for Linux

iNet Wireless Daemon (iwd) project aims to provide a comprehensive Wi-Fi
connectivity solution for Linux based devices. The core goal of the
project is to optimize resource utilization: storage, runtime memory and
link-time costs. This is accomplished by not depending on any external
libraries and utilizes features provided by the Linux Kernel to the
maximum extent possible. The result is a self-contained environment that
only depends on the Linux Kernel and the runtime C library.

To start iwd at boot, add the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

  # Start iwd
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd ]; then
      /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd start
  fi

and to stop it at shutdown, add the following line to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown

  # Stop iwd
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd ]; then
      /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd stop
  fi

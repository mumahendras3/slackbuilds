XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX,
KawPow, CryptoNight, AstroBWT and GhostRider unified CPU/GPU miner and
RandomX benchmark.

You need to have an appropriate config.json file before starting the
XMRig daemon. Use the online configuration wizard
(https://xmrig.com/wizard) or the provided sample file
(/etc/xmrig/config.json.sample) as a starting point.

Additional notes:
Before running the SlackBuild script, create the "xmrig" user/group:

    groupadd -g 376 xmrig
    useradd -u 376 -g 376 -c "XMRig daemon (xmrig) user" \
        -d /dev/null -s /sbin/nologin xmrig

By default, there is a minimum of 1% (1 minute in 100 minutes) donation
that can't be disabled at runtime. Pass DONATELESS=yes to disable it at
compile time:

    DONATELESS=yes ./xmrig.SlackBuild

You can still enable donation later at runtime by setting the
"donate-level" option to a value greater than 0.

Optional dependency:
- msr-tools (for enabling MSR mod while running xmrig as non-root user)

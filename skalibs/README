skalibs is a package centralizing the free software / open source C
development files used for building all software at skarnet.org: it
contains essentially general-purpose libraries. You will need to
install skalibs if you plan to build skarnet.org software. The point
is that you won't have to download and compile big libraries, and care
about portability issues, everytime you need to build a package: do it
only once.

skalibs can also be used as a sound basic start for C development.
There are a lot of general-purpose libraries out there; but if your
main goal is to produce small and secure C code with a focus on system
programming, skalibs might be for you.

NOTE:
By default, this script will only build the static version of skalibs.
If you want to also build the shared libraries, pass BUILD_SHARED=yes
environment variable to the script like below:

    BUILD_SHARED=yes ./skalibs.SlackBuild

Similarly, to avoid building the static libraries, you can pass
BUILD_STATIC=no to the script. For example, to only build the shared
libraries and not the static ones, you can do something like

    BUILD_SHARED=yes BUILD_STATIC=no ./skalibs.SlackBuild

The upstream recommends building skarnet.org softwares with the static
version of skalibs as most of skarnet.org softwares are small enough
that using shared libraries are generally not worth using, hence the
default behaviour of this script. So, unless you really need the shared
libraries (e.g. to build your own software), building only the static
libraries should be sufficient for most users.

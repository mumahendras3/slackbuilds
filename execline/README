execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh ; but its
syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The
execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text
file; the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb
script.

execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile,
its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax,
and has no security issues.

execline requires skalibs at build time but not at run time.

All examples in execline documentation at skarnet.org still assume
that the execline binaries are available in /command (following the
slashpackage convention). This slackbuild script install the binaries
in /usr/bin for consistency with other user installed programs so adapt
the examples accordingly.

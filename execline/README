execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh; but its
syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The
execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text
file; the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb
script.

execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile,
its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax,
and has no security issues.

execline requires skalibs at build-time but not at run-time if it's
linked against the static version of the skalibs library. skalibs
becomes run-time requirement if you link it against the shared version
of the skalibs library.

s6 is a small suite of programs for UNIX, designed to allow process
supervision (a.k.a service supervision), in the line of daemontools
and runit, as well as various operations on processes and daemons. It
is meant to be a toolbox for low-level process and service
administration, providing different sets of independent tools that can
be used within or without the framework, and that can be assembled
together to achieve powerful functionality with a very small amount of
code.

skalibs is only required at build time, not run time.

If you want to use s6 alongside Slackware's default init system,
pass INSTALL=no to s6.SlackBuild script:

INSTALL=no ./s6.SlackBuild


Some hints for using this package alongside Slackware's default
init system:

I added the following to my /etc/inittab:

# S6
sv:12345:respawn:/usr/bin/s6-svscanboot

Then did a 'telinit q' to start it.

Note that the default s6-svscanboot provided disables polling
(-t0). So after adding a new service to /service you should call:

/usr/bin/s6-svscanctl -a /service

where /service is a directory that contains all the services that
s6 will supervise. You can change it to other places such as /etc/service,
/var/service, etc. and adapt the provided /usr/bin/s6-svscanboot script
to scan the new service directory.

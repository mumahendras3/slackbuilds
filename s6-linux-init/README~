s6-linux-init is a set of minimalistic tools to create a s6-based init system,
including a /sbin/init binary, on a Linux kernel.

s6-linux-init is meant to automate creation of scripts revolving around
the use of other skarnet.org tools, especially s6, in order to provide a
complete booting environment with integrated supervision and logging without
having to hand-craft all the details.

Please read the documentation for the s6-linux-init-maker program
(/usr/doc/s6-linux-init/doc/s6-linux-init-maker.html) carefully, but if you're
impatient, you can also read the quickstart guide (also in the same directory),
which includes a small FAQ.

skalibs is only required at build-time, not run-time.

Visual Studio Code.

VS Code is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code
editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug
cycle. Code provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an
extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

To compile this successfully you need to set nodejs' memory limit at least
4096 MB (this script defaults to 8192 MB). You can set this at compile time by
setting the MEMLIM variable as such:

MEMLIM=8192 ./code-oss.SlackBuild
